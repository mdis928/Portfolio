For the first project, we were required to make different different server side API calls. My teammates and I created a Dinner Meal Planning API where you plan each meal and drink each day of the week.
For our second project, we needed to create a full stack web application. My teammates and I decided to make a social media site. This app uses handlebars, CRUD functions, with MySQL.
I have also provided four homework assignments where I exceeded in front end and back end development.
