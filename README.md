# Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! 

This webpage is a startup. As I continue the through this course, I will continue to tweak it and add make it look more professional. 

In the webpage, you will see my name in the header and a workable nav bar. Feel free to click on the nav bar.

If you click on the "About me" or scroll down, you will see a bio about my past work experience and my future goal.

If you click on the "Portfolio" or scroll down, you will see the first homework assignment, Horiseon. This homework was to focusing on refactoring. If you click on the picture, it will take you to the github repository and you can take look at the code.

There are smaller placeholder images below the main link. In the future, these placeholder images will be replaced with other homeworks and miniprojects. If you do click on them, it will take you to my github. 

If you click on "Contact' or scroll down, you will see links to my linkedin and my github. I didn't want to give out my phone number out. I prefer if recruiters contact me through LinkedIn. However, I will tweak this section as I continue onto the course. I may add a resume section but I may put my resume in my linkedin.

As for the presentation of the webpage, I made sure that I have a responsive layout. The text, headers, and sections wrap and flex when you make the window size smaller. 

The text also becomes small when a max-width of 950px is reached.

When you hover onto the headers, nav links, they change color

Also when the window size changes the profile picture and the Horiseon picture adjust. Media queries doing their job!

I hope that this webpage is a good start to demostrate my skillset. Feel free to take a look at my code!
