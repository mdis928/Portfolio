# Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! 

This webpage is a startup. As I continue the through this course, I will continue to tweak it and add make it look more professional. 

In the webpage, you will see my name in the header and a workable nav bar. Feel free to click on the nav bar.

If you click on the "About me" or scroll down, you will see a bio about my past work experience and my future goal.

If you click on the "Portfolio" or scroll down, you will see the first project. We were required to make different different server side API calls. My teammates and I created a Dinner Meal Planning API where you plan each meal and drink each day of the week.

Below are two homework assignments. I have added the horiseon refactoring assignment where we need to clean up the html semantically. The other homework assignment was a day planner where a third party was used.

If you click on "Contact' or scroll down, you will see links to my linkedin and my github. I didn't want to give out my phone number out. I prefer if recruiters contact me through LinkedIn. However, I will tweak this section as I continue onto the course.

I have added a resume link. Please click on the link in the top right of the portfolio page to visit my linkedin page.

As for the presentation of the webpage, I made sure that I have a responsive layout. The text, headers, and sections wrap and flex when you make the window size smaller. 

The text also becomes small when a max-width of 950px is reached.

When you hover onto the headers, nav links, they change color.

Also when the window size changes the profile picture and the Horiseon picture adjust.

I hope that this webpage is a good start to demostrate my skillset. Feel free to take a look at my code!
