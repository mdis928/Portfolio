                        Hello, my name is Michael DiSanto and my goal to swtich from accounting/finance to STEM and become completely obsess with my work. 
                        In 2015, I graduated from Bloomsburg University with a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration with concentration 
                        in Finance and a minor in Spanish. During my time at Bloomsburg, I played all four years on the men's tennis team,
                        and I also had the opportunity to study abroad in Spain. 
                     </P>

                <p class="bio">
                    After college, my previous work employment was from teaching tennis to working various jobs in asset management.
                    As I am going through this journey called life, I have acculumated a lot of knowledge about how the world and 
                    I have come to the conclustion that working in asset management is a complete waste of time. Although its important 
                    to understand, I think its more important to get involved in STEM. I believe learning how to code is a great start to 
                    that path.
